        <p> Created by: Patrick, Shazena, and Timmy </p>
        <p> You are to test your ability to decode math problems, <br>
        ideally with your mind. <br>
        You have three mental lives, <br>
        better choose what is right. <br>
        Feel free to take out a piece of paper and a pen, <br>
        but you better be fast, <br>
        You are set on a clock, <br>
        so shoot while you last. </p>
